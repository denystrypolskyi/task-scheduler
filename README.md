## 🌐 Deployment

The frontend is hosted on Google Firebase. You can try out the app [here]([https://time2num-e4729.web.app/](https://task-scheduler-6cfad.firebaseapp.com/)).

**Note:** If the app is loading slowly, please be patient and wait for a minute. This is because the backend server may need to start after periods of inactivity.
